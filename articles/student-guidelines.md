# Momentum Student Guidelines

We will spend a lot of time together over the course of the next sixteen weeks. We’ve got a lot of work to do! You’ll be introduced to a lot of new concepts, you’ll write (and read) a lot of code, you’ll learn to use the tools of the trade, and you’ll begin to establish the habits and practices of a professional developer.

## Expectations

There’s a small set of expectations that make this learning environment work. "You" is you, the student; “we” are the instructors.

- _You will ask questions without reservation._ If you have a question, ask it. Don’t hide it; we can’t read your mind.

- _You will attempt all assignments._ We don’t expect you’ll complete every one. They are hard, and half of programming is learning from our mistakes. You have to try all of them and turn them in, though.

- _You will treat everyone with respect._ You’re going to meet people not like you here. You’re going to wonder why someone’s not getting it sometimes, and you’re going to wonder why everyone but you is getting it. Learning to program is fun but frustrating. Don’t take those frustrations out on others.

- _You will not cut-and-paste code._ This is a hard-learned lesson for us. When you cut and paste code, even code you fully understand, you miss out on the learning experience. Use examples and learn from them, but even if you’re using a snippet verbatim, **type it out**.

- _We will give you honest feedback._ We will let you know how you’re doing and what you need help with.

- _We will always be affirming._ You can do this! We will never forget that and will remind you of it when you forget.

- _Everyone has a voice._ This is your classroom as much as it is ours. Your voice is important. Everyone gets a chance to speak, and we will proactively make room for you.

- _We will all act with personal integrity._ Own your mistakes and tell the truth.

In short: we will take responsibility for guiding and mentoring you while you’re here; you will take responsibility for getting the most out of this program.

## Community standards

Momentum is above all a community of continuous learners. Each one of us helps to build this community and our learning environment each day. We’ve given careful thought to the things we value in each other and in our community as a whole.

### Our Learning Environment and Values

Together we create an environment that is supportive of the hard work of learning to code.

We collaborate with each other, and we give each other space for focused time when we need it.

At Momentum, it is safe to ask questions, to make mistakes, and to try new things without a guarantee that everything will go perfectly well.

We are curious and open minded, receptive to each other’s thoughts and ideas, and generous with our help.

Patience, kindness, and compassion towards ourselves and towards others will make meeting our shared and individual goals more possible.

We celebrate each other’s successes and empathize with each other’s struggles.

### Social Rules

We’ve borrowed the social rules defined by [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in New York, a community for experienced programmers to learn together. They are not focused on those new to coding, but they are focused on building a supportive learning environment, and we really like their way of thinking.

Below are [the social rules defined by the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/manual). The text is written by the Recurse Center, because we couldn’t have said it better, but we’ve adopted the letter and spirit as our own. These rules go into practical detail about respectful collaboration and discourse in a tech context.

### No feigning surprise

The first rule means you shouldn’t act surprised when people say they don’t know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can’t believe you don’t know what the stack is!") and non-technical things (“You don’t know who RMS is?!”). Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit: When people feign surprise, it’s usually to make them feel better about themselves and others feel worse. And even when that’s not the intention, it’s almost always the effect.

### No well-actually’s

A well-actually happens when someone says something that’s almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation. This doesn’t mean the Recurse Center isn’t about truth-seeking or that we don’t care about being precise. Almost all well-actually’s in our experience are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking.

### No back-seat driving

If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn’t intermittently lob advice across the room. This can lead to the "too many cooks" problem, but more important, it can be rude and disruptive to half-participate in a conversation. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t help, offer advice, or join conversations. On the contrary, we encourage all those things. Rather, it just means that when you want to help out or work with others, you should fully engage and not just butt in sporadically.

### No subtle -isms

Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias. This one is different from the rest, because it covers a class of behaviors instead of one very specific pattern.

Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying "It’s so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it’s not a big deal to mess up; you just apologize and move on.

## Using code you didn’t write

Inevitably you will find code online that makes sense to include in what you’re writing. Every developer does it. You will find code examples on Stack Overflow, in CSS-Tricks articles, in documentation and blog posts. The nature of this work means that concepts are often best explained with examples.

It is fine to use a line or two of code you found somewhere else *if you understand what it does*. **Never** cut and paste code. If you are using code you found elsewhere, type it out by hand to make sure you understand it and remember it.

If you want to use a longer snippet of code, it’s probably not a good idea to do that. If you feel you have good reasons, please attribute the borrowed code in a comment, along with a URL, if possible.

Above all, don’t pass off work by someone else as your own. Not only does this violate our Code of Conduct, but it also hinders your learning and will not serve you in becoming a professional developer.

## Using Slack

We use Slack for communication. Please read and follow the [Momentum Community Slack guidelines here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1updvgMnO2xAAfP46oW__d3-nhv4hPodW7WvxKWX87JA/edit?usp=sharing
).

Slack lets us organize conversations in different channels. You've already been added to your team channel (#team-[your-team-number]), but you'll also want to join the conversations with Momentum alums in #general and #code-help. There are other channels you can explore as well, by clicking on "Channels" in the Slack sidebar.

When asking instructors for code help, _please post your question in a public channel_. Openly asking questions will benefit everyone on your team, so we strongly prefer discussing them publicly. Use direct messages when you need to discuss personal information.

## Assignments

Monday through Wednesday each week, you will have a daily lab assignment to work on. On Thursday, you’ll get a longer weekend project assignment. We might refer to assignments as "homework," even though you’ll do a lot of this work during the lab hours.

### Daily Assignments

We’ll introduce each day’s assignment early in the day during class time. We’ll discuss the assignment in class and use it to frame our exploration of the day’s topics. You’ll begin working on the assignment after the morning lecture. You can expect to spend 4-6 hours each day working on it. Each lab is due before the start of class the next morning.

### Weekly Projects

On Thursdays, you’ll get a longer, more involved project to work on that afternoon, on lab day on Friday, and through the weekend. It will be due on Monday morning before the start of class. These projects will sometimes be done collabroratively in pairs or groups.

### GitHub Classroom

Your instructor will share a link to that day’s assignment using Github Classroom. When you follow that link, you’ll be asked to accept the assignment. Your assignment and any associated files you need will be in the repo that is created when you accept the assignment.

Go to that repo on GitHub and clone it. Make frequent commits while you are working, and push your work to the remote repo often.

## Working on assignments

### 1. Understand the assignment

Before you start, be sure you understand the assignment. Being able to restate what you’re being asked to do in your own words will clarify what you need to do and help you create a task list.

### 2. Break a large task down into smaller ones

This is an absolutely necessary step that is worth spending some thinking about. *Careful planning can save you a lot of development time.* You’ll find it much more manageable to work from a developer task list and do one thing at a time. Working from your restatement of the assignment, identify steps that you will need to take to get to completion. Then, go over your steps and see if those steps can be broken down into smaller ones.

Start with one step. It doesn’t have to be the first one. Work on something you know you can do, and build from there.

### 3. Write code

Once you know what you need to do, it’s tempting to start with research, but instead, start with trying to write some code. Push yourself to rely on your understanding before you look things up.

This trial-and-error technique can feel inefficient, and it can feel really slow at first. Don’t worry about that too much.

1. Write a line or a few lines of code.

2. **RUN THE CODE** (in the browser, or the console, or whatever).

3. If it ran and did what you wanted, great! Start over at step #1.

4. If it didn’t run, or the outcome wasn’t right, change the code and run it again.

You want to establish a quick feedback loop. Running the code will generate results -- an error or an outcome -- and that is great! It’s information about what you need to do next.

### 4. Google

Google everything, and get to know what resources are reliable. Copy and paste error messages you’re getting. Read documentation, but don’t get bogged down in reading articles or blog posts. Practice skimming, find an idea, and **try it out**.

Knowing what to Google takes some time, but with continued practice, it will get easier to find the right words and phrases to search for.

### 5. Take a break

At a certain point, it is no longer fruitful to continue focusing on a problem. Your brain needs time to rest.

Step away from the computer when you need a break. Go outside, sit with your colleagues and friends, and take some time away from your work. Take a real lunch break.

When you come back to your code, you’ll have a fresh perspective and new ideas.

### Knowing when to quit at the end of the day

When to turn in homework is your call, but remember that it does not have to be perfect. If you’re not making any more progress and you feel like you are at the limit of what you can do, it’s time to submit what you have. We’d rather that you come to class well-rested and with specific questions than stay up too late going around in circles.

## Developers are problem-solvers, not wizards

Experienced developers are really good at knowing how to find out what they need to know, and where to look for that information. Part of your training here is learning to be a creative, resourceful problem-solver.

One of our goals is to make you as self-sufficient as possible, so we will push you to try to figure things out on your own using as many resources as you can.

Learning to code is hard work. It can sometimes feel like a roller coaster, with successes and failures in quick succession. Students have moments of elation and moments of despair. This is normal! Just keep working steadily, and know that it takes time for comprehension to develop.

The hard work gets easier when we help each other. It’s good to ask for help, and it’s good to offer help. We’ll expect each of you to do both.

## Giving Help

We are a team of developers, and we will practice collaborative techniques throughout our 16 weeks.

Being open to questions and requests for help is part of the territory.

It’s also totally fine if you don’t want to be interrupted at times! You can signal that you are working in a focused way by letting people know in Slack that you’re taking some time away by yourself, by working in one of the quiet rooms, or simply putting headphones on while you’re working. If we notice that you’re doing this all the time, we’ll probably want to chat with you about balancing that solitary time with working in collaboration with others.

### If you feel like you’re getting it

That’s awesome! Offer to explain what you know to someone else. Articulating technical things is not the same as being able to write the code. This skill is necessary for technical interviews and on the job, and we will practice it often. Helping someone else will force you to really understand what you are talking about, solidifying your grasp on the concepts. It will also help you identify gaps in your understanding so that you can fill them in! It’s a key part of our learning model.

If you’ve come to Momentum with a good amount of previous learning, or if you’re picking things up especially quickly, we’ll be looking to you to be a resource for other students.

### If someone asks a question in Slack

Don’t wait for an instructor to answer it! Please venture to contribute your perspective if there’s anything you can add. Even helping to clarify a question, or saying that you have the same question, is a contribution!

### If you just figured something out

Share your discovery and insight! Look for opportunities to help others, or share a resource in Slack.

## Getting help

Sometimes you’re stuck. You've tried a bunch of things, you've Googled, and you are out of ideas. When you need help, you have several options.

### Ask other students

You are encouraged to work together and discuss what you’re working on. You can also ask each other questions, read each other’s code, and learn from each other!

Ask your question in the team Slack channel, or in #code-help where you are likely to get help from alums.

### Ask an instructor

You can always ask us general questions, following up on what we’ve covered in class, or anything else you’ve encountered and want to know more about.

Before you ask us a question about a specific code problem, be sure you’ve worked through the steps covered in Assignments above. But don’t keep struggling in silence if you’re really stuck. If you’ve struggled for 30 minutes and haven’t made any progress, it’s probably time to talk to an instructor.

When you come to us with a question about code you’re stuck on, we’ll want you to talk about the following:

- What’s the problem you are seeing? It’s helpful to be able to ask your question as precisely as you can.

- What have you already tried? What results did you get?

- What did you learn when you Googled this?

### Rubber Ducking 🐥

[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a real technique! When you are stuck on something, sometimes all you need is to talk through the issue out loud. For this, you don’t even need a real person; you just need a listener. A rubber duck could do it!

In practice we often end up leaning on another person to be a rubber duck for us, and it’s just a thing we developers do for each other. Know that you will at different times be a rubber duck and need a rubber duck!
